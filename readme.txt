1) In the attached file (w_data.dat), you’ll find daily weather data.   
Download this text file, then write a program to output the day number 
(column one) with the smallest temperature spread (the maximum temperature 
is the second column, the minimum the third column).

 The 2 file in Weather directory accomplished the task.
it actually returns multiple days if there is more than one smallest spread.

2) The attached soccer.dat file contains the results from the English Premier League.  
The columns labeled ‘F’ and ‘A’ contain the total number of goals scored for and against 
each team in that season (so Arsenal scored 79 goals against opponents, and had 36 goals 
scored against them). Write a program to print the name of the team with the smallest 
difference in ‘for’ and ‘against’ goals.

 The 2 file in Soccer directory accomplished the task.
it actually returns multiple teams if there is more than one smallest spread. The difference between 
"F" and "A" is >= 0.

Is the way you wrote the second program influenced by writing the first?

Yes, but I took a more procedure approach without creating new data classes fro simpler processing instead.
